# Ultra-Lite Container

An ultra-lightweight DI container, filling a Pimple-shaped gap in a Container-Interop world.

Using anonymous functions as factories for creating dependencies.  Inspired by Pimple DI.

Aims for full compliance with the Container-Interop standard, including the optional Delegate Lookup feature.

v0.1.0 is backwards-compatible with PHP 5.5.  Subsequent stable releases require PHP 7.

## Usage

### Setting services individually

```php
$container->set(
    'service-id',
    function (\Interop\Container\ContainerInterface $container) {
        return new \stdClass();
    }
);
```

### Setting services from a config file

Add factory closures to the container inline, or using a config file as below.

Example config file:

```php
return [
    'service-id' =>
        function (\Interop\Container\ContainerInterface $container) {
            return new \stdClass();
        },
];
```

Using config file:

```php
$container->configureFromFile('/wherever/config/di.php');
```


### Service retrieval

Get services out of the container like this:

```php
$object = $container->get('service-id');
```

### See if a service exists

Check if something is in the container like this:

```php
$thingExists = $container->has('service-id');
```

### Use with a delegate container

If you're not using the Delegate Container concept from the Container-Interop standard, ignore this bit.  If you are,
do this:

```php
$container = new \UltraLite\Container\Container();
// ... (configure container)
$myCompositeContainer->addContainer($container); // or whatever
$container->setDelegateContainer($myCompositeContainer);
```

When the container is asked for a service using ```get()```, it will return it.  It will pass the Delegate Container
into the factory closure, so it is from here that any dependencies of your service will be retrieved.

## Alternatives

Ultra-Lite Container was originally inspired by [Pimple](https://github.com/silexphp/Pimple), which still makes an
excellent DI container in PHP.  Container-Interop compliant wrappers are available.  Another excellent project,
[Picotainer](https://github.com/thecodingmachine/picotainer), is along similar lines, with the principle difference
being that the dependencies are defined at the time of instantiation of the container.  The
[Container Interop](https://github.com/container-interop/container-interop) team have prepared a full list of PHP DI
containers known to comply with the standard, so plenty of options are available.

## Installation

```json
"require": {
    "ultra-lite/container": "*"
}
```
